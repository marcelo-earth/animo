# Animo

Welcome to Animo ‚ù§Ô∏è, an easy way to make cool videos from text.

So you maybe have used someday editors like VSCode? Cursor? Windsurf or that new one, Kiro?

OK. So Animo is a free extension for them. You install it, you sign in with your Google Account and that's it! ü•π

Next time you talk to the AI from your editor just tell him/her/them/it, "Create a solar system" and boom! there you have it
