# Animo

Welcome to **Animo ❤️**, an easy way to make cool videos from text.

So you maybe have used someday editors like  
**[VSCode](vscode:extension/Animo.animo)**?  
**[Cursor](cursor:extension/Animo.animo)**?  
**[Windsurf](windsurf:extension/Animo.animo)**?  
or that new one, **[Kiro](kiro:extension/Animo.animo)**?

OK. So **Animo** is a **free extension** for them.  
You install it, sign in with your Google Account — and that’s it! 🥹

Next time you talk to the AI from your editor, just tell it:  
> “Create a solar system”

…and boom! there you have it.
